Now that I was 18 I couldnt just resort to calling older men pedophiles for dating me, I slowed down a bit. Maybe I should start a movement that makes my attitude more common, but itd be a ton of work to promote. And thats when I learned the grand irony of being pretty, it destroys your dopamine levels, you dont wanna do shit. Dudes just buy me drinks, give me things, everything-- what incentive do I have to try? Is this why women make less? We dont feel like trying? Actually I want a stat on the women who quit on their small business, what percent of them are hot? Or what if their business does really well because theyre hot? I guess my point is, if our cultures ran by looks... the stats should take looks into consideration. I promise, Ill have a political takeaway from my high school years, I just need the numbers... ...Watching your Dad kill himself really fucks you up."
